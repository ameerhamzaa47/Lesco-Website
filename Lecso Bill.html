            </div>
            <p>Saving your LESCO Bill and lowering your electricity consumption is one key to effective resource management. This process involves practical steps including switching to energy-efficient appliances. Appliances with high energy-efficiency ratings use less electricity and therefore decrease overall usage.</p>
            <p>Next, remember to turn off lights and unplug devices when not in use. Even when idle, some devices still consume energy, so unplugging can lead to considerable savings. Focusing on reducing peak-hour consumption can also decrease your bill, as rates during these high-demand periods are usually higher.</p>
            <p>Finally, regular maintenance of your electric devices can ensure they’re working at optimum efficiency, thereby consuming less energy. Understanding and implementing these instructions can result in noticeable savings on your Lesco Bill.</p>
